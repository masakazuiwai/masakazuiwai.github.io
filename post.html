											<h3>June 30, 2020: Niyogi Lab</h3>
											<p>I would like to say something about Niyogi lab, where my research at LBNL/UC Berkeley started. 
											The author of the review paper on NPQ that I first read when I was in grad school was Kris. 
											At that time, I never thought that I would work in his lab at UC Berkeley. 
											It's been already 5 years since I joined his lab in 2015. 
											I remember doing science in Japan was not always fun and sometimes really hard. 
											I think it is just a different system in general, and many early-career researchers in Japan would feel the same way. 
											There are many things that I like to be in Japan, and I sometimes miss that a lot. 
											But, since I got here, I have been enjoying science and working as a researcher in Niyogi lab. 
										    Kris is so kind and knowledgeable, and all his lab members study different topics related to photosynthesis. 
										    I have learned many things from Kris and the lab members every day. 
										    And I'm very grateful for that. 
										    Also, many people say that LBNL/UC Berkeley is a dream place for researchers, and I think that it is totally true. 
										    Honestly, I don't think I have another place that I want to be right now...
										    </p>

											<h3>April 6, 2020: Welcome!</h3>
											<p>I had always made an excuse by saying "too busy." 
											Well, it's 2020, the year that changed everything in every way at every aspect. 
											Most of us have stayed at home. 
											Fortunately, I still have many things to do at home for research. 
											But, definitely there is more time being at home than being in the lab. 
											Maybe it's time. 
											So, here you are! Welcome to my website! 
											I always wanted to have my own website about my research on photosynthesis. 
											I hope you find photosynthesis and my research interesting. 
											FYI, I made it more general so that those who are not familiar with photosynthesis can see how great photosynthesis is.
											Some of them are basic, but going back to the basics is always important. 
											Please check my publication to find out more details!

															<a href="about.html#cv" class="image left"><img src="images/masa01.jpg" alt="" /></a>
															<p>Masa is a Research Scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) 
															and working in Niyogi Lab at University of California, Berkeley. 
															He moved to the US from Japan and obtained his B.S. degree in Botany from Humboldt State University in 2003. 
															He went back to Japan for obtaining a Ph.D. degree at Hokkaido University, 
															where he started research in photosynthesis. In 2015, he decided to move back to the US as 
															a postdoctoral researcher at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. 
															His research in photosynthesis involves an integrative approach that 
															combines molecular genetics, bioimaging, and biochemical reconstitution.</p>

															</header>
															<a class="image left"><img src="images/chloroplast01.gif" alt="" /></a>
															<p>This animated image shows a false-colored fluorescence image of a chloroplast 
															observed from the top to bottom by using a super-resolution microscope. 
															The size is about 8 Âµm (8/1000 mm) in diameter. 
															Each of the circular structures are grana - a part of photosynthetic membranes, 
															where water is split, and oxygen is generated through photosynthetic reactions. 
															Within each granum, numerous photosynthetic proteins exist to regulate the photosynthetic reactions. 
															The aim of my research is to understand how light energy triggers photosynthetic mechanisms 
															and how photosynthetic proteins and membranes have an impact on the regulations.

															<p>I am grateful for being able to work in the environment, 
															where IDEA (Inclusion, Diversity, Equity & Accountability) is valued. 
															As I am from Japan, where the majority of residents is Asian, 
															living in the US has definitely made me realize how I was not racially conscious. 
															So I understand that educating myself about IDEA values is necessary, and this is lifelong learning. 
															Thanks to the resources and programs provided by LBNL, I have been learning the IDEA values every day. 
															I continue to support and engage in LBNL's goal that is "to have IDEA become second nature for each person."

															<p>Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL or Berkeley Lab) was founded by a physicist Ernest Orlando Lawrence
